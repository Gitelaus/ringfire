I, Nathan Joshua Dawson, the creator of Ring of Fire, promise that the data provided by Facebook integration not be used for malicious purposes. The Ring of Fire application,
and it's server counter part, do not persist User information outside of the runtime environment (this may be subject to change with project development).
The information used is used soley for the purposes of entertainment and is not shared to any 3rd party websites, albeit advertising on the page may 
utilise data about the client but not outside of currently expected limits when integrating advertising. Your identity may appear to other users 
on the condition that you share a mutual friend whom is currently online, and in no other cirumstance can two users with no connections appear to each other.

The above conditions are subject to change with project development and specification changes.
